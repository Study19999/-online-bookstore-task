# Online Bookstore Application

## Description
This is a simple online bookstore application built with Spring Boot and Hibernate. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on books, authors, and genres. Users can search for books by title, author, or genre. The application uses RESTful APIs to handle various functionalities.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- Maven
- H2 database (for simplicity in the provided example; production applications may use a different database)

## Setup
### Database Configuration
1. Create an H2 database for the application.
2. Update the database configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database details:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:online-bookstore
    spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=your-username
    spring.datasource.password=your-password
    ```

### Running the Application
#### Using Maven
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the following command to build the project:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4. The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Using IDE
1. Import the project into your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
2. Run the `OnlineBookstoreApplication` class as a Java application.

### Short feedback:

- Was it easy to complete the task using AI? 
It wasn't necessary easy as some information/code provided had to be modified and there was a bit of going back and forth to receive the desired answer.

- How long did task take you to complete? (Please be honest, we need it to gather anonymized statistics) 
It took me about 6 hours to complete it.

- Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
The code was not 100% ready to run after generation. I had to adjust some small portions of the code and change some of the tests and had to make sure the Lombok is used correctly (GPT initially advised upon using @Data on Entities which is incorrect). As well, had to ask multiple times the same question untill I recieved a satisafactory answer.

- Which challenges did you face during completion of the task? 
The fact-checking of the answers, updating the tests generated by ChatGPT as some of them were not running and ensuring the code-coverage is sufficient.

- Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task? 
I found that ChatGPT was responding better to the following prompts: "Please generate tests for this controller/ for this method" (sometimes I did give specifics towards what kind of tests I need ChatGPT to generate) and "Can you generate an entity/model/controller/service class" (where I gave extra information about what the class should have and how it should behave).
